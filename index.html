        	<h2>Hello There,</h2>
            <p>
            	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp My name is Tate. I'm a part time student at UC. I'm also working as an intern developer for an insurance company.
            	I got an Associates in Software Development from Sinclair and then transfered to UC for my Bachelors. My favorite games
            	are Diablo 2, Conker's BFD, Left 4 Dead 2, Red Dead Redemption, Battlefield 1, Broforce, Bloodborne, and currently No man's sky on PSVR. 
            	I have to do a lot of web development at work so I look forward to learning more web development skills in this course.
            </p>
